# Summary

**\[Required\]**

# Motivation

**\[Required\]**

Describe the problem that needs to be addressed with enough detail for
someone familiar with the project to understand. Generally one to two
short paragraphs. Additional details can be placed in the background
section as needed. Cover **what** the issue is and **why** it needs to
be addressed. Link to github issues if relevant.

## Goals

**\[Optional \- if not applicable omit\]**

List out any additional goals in bullet points. Goals may be aspirational / difficult to measure but guide the proposal.

### Non Goals

**\[Optional \- if not applicable omit\]**

List out any items which are out of scope / specifically not required in bullet points. Indicates the scope of the proposal and issue being resolved.

## Requirements

**\[Optional \- if not applicable omit\]**

List out any additional requirements in numbered subheadings.

**\<numbered subheadings\>**

### REQ \<\#\> \<Title\>

Describe the requirement in as much detail as necessary for others to understand it and how it applies to the DEP. Keep in mind that requirements should be measurable and will be used to determine if a DEP has been successfully implemented or not.

Requirement names should be prefixed using a monotonically increasing number such as “REQ 1 \<Title\>” followed by “REQ 2 \<Title\>” and so on. Use title casing when naming requirements. Requirement names should be as descriptive as possible while remaining as terse as possible.

Use all-caps, bolded terms like **MUST** and **SHOULD** when describing each requirement. See [RFC-2119](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2119) for additional information.


# Proposal

**\[Required\]**

Describe the high level design / proposal. Use sub sections as needed, but start with an overview and then dig into the details. Try to provide images and diagrams to facilitate understanding.

# Implementation Details

**\[Optional \- if not applicable omit\]**

Add additional detailed items here including interface signatures, etc. Add anything that is relevant but seems more of a detail than central to the proposal. Use sub sections / bullet points as needed. Try to provide images and diagrams to facilitate understanding. If applicable link to PR.

## Deferred to Implementation

**\[Optional \- if not applicable omit\]**

List out items that are under discussion but that will be resolved only during implementation / code review. 

# Implementation Phases

**\[Optional \- if not applicable omit\]**

List out phases of implementation (can be single phase). Give each phase a monotonically increasing number; example “Phase 0” followed by “Phase 1” and so on. Give phases titles if it makes sense.

## Phase \<\#\> \<Optional Title\>

**Release Target**: Date

**Effort Estimate**: \<estimate of time and number of engineers to complete the phase\>

**Work Item(s):** \<one or more links to github issues\>

**Supported API / Behavior:**
