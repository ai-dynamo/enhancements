### REQ \<\#\> \<Title\>

Describe the requirement in as much detail as necessary for others to understand it and how it applies to the DEP. Keep in mind that requirements should be measurable and will be used to determine if a DEP has been successfully implemented or not.

Requirement names should be prefixed using a monotonically increasing number such as “REQ 1 \<Title\>” followed by “REQ 2 \<Title\>” and so on. Use title casing when naming requirements. Requirement names should be as descriptive as possible while remaining as terse as possible.

Use all-caps, bolded terms like **MUST** and **SHOULD** when describing each requirement. See [RFC-2119](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2119) for additional information.
