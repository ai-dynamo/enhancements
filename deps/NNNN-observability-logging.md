# Summary

This document outlines and defines the Logging framework for Dynamo, providing a unified approach to structured logging, log aggregation, and event correlation across components.

# Motivation

While current Python logging and Rust tracing capabilities (info/debug/warn) may be adequate for some use cases, alternative solutions such as Loki warrant consideration for enhanced logging capabilities.

## Goals

The Logging framework addresses these challenges by providing a unified approach that:

* Improves consistent structured logging visibility across the system
* Promotes best practices in log collection and event management across all components


## Requirements

Logging requirements and implementation details are currently under discussion and will be addressed in a future iteration of this proposal.
