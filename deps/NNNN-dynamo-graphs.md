# Summary


# Motivation

Currently the definition of a `graph` and a more general `deployment`
in dynamo are not fully specified and in some places graphs are used
for dependencies and sometimes used to indicate a control flow. 

We'll clarify the architecture and document the decsisions here to
help clarify and discuss any changes needed. In cases where no change
is neededd this will serve as a "retro-active" proposal.


## Goals

* Define the semantics of a dynamo graph

* Define how graphs are constructed in `python` and in `rust` 

* Define intermediate representation of graph 


### Non Goals

* Radically reset current terms and definitions if not needed

## Requirements

### REQ \<\#\> \<Title\>

TBD

# Proposal
