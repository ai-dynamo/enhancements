# Tracing

## Requirements

#### REQ 1: OpenTelemetry Tracing Integration

* **Description:** The observability framework MUST integrate with OpenTelemetry for distributed tracing capabilities, leveraging OpenTelemetry's comprehensive tracing features including span creation, context propagation, trace correlation, and sampling strategies.
* **Rationale:** OpenTelemetry provides industry-standard distributed tracing capabilities that enable end-to-end request tracking across multiple components and services. Key features include automatic instrumentation, flexible sampling configurations, trace context propagation across process boundaries, and integration with popular tracing backends like Jaeger, Zipkin, and cloud-native solutions. This standardization ensures compatibility with existing observability ecosystems and provides rich debugging and performance analysis capabilities.
* **Measurability:** Verify that components can create and manage spans using OpenTelemetry APIs, confirm that trace context is properly propagated across component boundaries, and validate that tracing data can be exported to configured backends. Test that sampling strategies work as expected and that trace correlation enables end-to-end request tracking.

**Note:** The specific implementation details for OpenTelemetry tracing integration, including span lifecycle management, context propagation mechanisms, and backend configuration options, are currently under active development and will be detailed in a future iteration of this proposal.
