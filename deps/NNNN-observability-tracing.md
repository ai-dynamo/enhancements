# Summary

This document outlines and defines the Tracing framework for Dynamo, providing a unified approach to distributed tracing, span management, and request correlation across components.

# Motivation

The Dynamo system currently lacks a unified approach to distributed tracing, with different components implementing their own tracing solutions using disparate libraries. This fragmentation results in compatibility issues, performance and safety concerns, and inconsistent trace formats that impact service reliability and system observability.

Relying on various different libraries often results in interoperability problems between components, making it difficult to correlate traces across the system and maintain consistent tracing practices. This approach also increases maintenance costs due to varying coding styles and introduces potential performance and safety risks.

## Goals

The Tracing framework addresses these challenges by providing a unified approach that:

* Improves consistent distributed tracing visibility across the system
* Promotes best practices in trace collection and span management across all components
* Avoids the use of disparate raw libraries that could compromise safety, performance, consistency, and maintainability


## Requirements

#### REQ 1: OpenTelemetry Tracing Integration

* **Description:** The observability framework MUST integrate with OpenTelemetry for distributed tracing capabilities, leveraging OpenTelemetry's comprehensive tracing features including span creation, context propagation, trace correlation, and sampling strategies.
* **Rationale:** OpenTelemetry provides industry-standard distributed tracing capabilities that enable end-to-end request tracking across multiple components and services. Key features include automatic instrumentation, flexible sampling configurations, trace context propagation across process boundaries, and integration with popular tracing backends like Jaeger, Zipkin, and cloud-native solutions. This standardization ensures compatibility with existing observability ecosystems and provides rich debugging and performance analysis capabilities.
* **Measurability:** Verify that components can create and manage spans using OpenTelemetry APIs, confirm that trace context is properly propagated across component boundaries, and validate that tracing data can be exported to configured backends. Test that sampling strategies work as expected and that trace correlation enables end-to-end request tracking.

**Note:** The specific implementation details for OpenTelemetry tracing integration, including span lifecycle management, context propagation mechanisms, and backend configuration options, are currently under active development and will be detailed in a future iteration of this proposal.
