# Summary

A common format and process for proposing changes to Dynamo architecture and processes in order to:



A standardized development process for Kubernetes is proposed, in order to:

provide a common structure for proposing changes to Kubernetes
ensure that the motivation for a change is clear
allow for the enumeration of stability milestones and stability graduation criteria
persist project information in a Version Control System (VCS) for future Kubernauts
support the creation of high-value, user-facing information such as:
an overall project development roadmap
motivation for impactful user-facing changes
reserve GitHub issues for tracking work in flight, instead of creating "umbrella" issues
ensure community participants can successfully drive changes to completion across one or more releases while stakeholders are adequately represented throughout the process
This process is supported by a unit of work called a Kubernetes Enhancement Proposal, or KEP. A KEP attempts to combine aspects of

a feature, and effort-tracking document
a product requirements document
a design document
into one file, which is created incrementally in collaboration with one or more Special Interest Groups (SIGs).
