# Summary

# Motivation

The workflow of moving from local development to cluster or cloud
deployment is fundamental to the dynamo user experience. As there are
multiple ways of launching and interacting with dynamo components -
this doc aims to flesh out the behavior and relationship between each
of these phases as well the artifacts of each.


## Goals

* Define the basic requirements and capabilities for moving from local development to cloud deployment.

* Define each stage and how each stage relates to the next and how they relate to dynamo components and graphs

* Define a common IR that captures the requirements for launching dynamo graphs locally and in the cloud.
